## 🎬 Demo

Here's a simple example of querying entities using the ShotGrid MCP server:

## ✨ Features

- 🚀 High-performance implementation based on fastmcp
- 🛠 Complete CRUD operation toolset
- 🖼 Dedicated thumbnail download/upload tools
- 🔄 Efficient connection pool management
- 🔌 Direct ShotGrid API access through MCP tools
- 📝 Enhanced note and playlist management
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage with pytest
- 📦 Dependency management with UV
- 🌐 Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

Install using UV:
```bash
uv pip install shotgrid-mcp-server
```

### Quick Usage

Once installed, you can start the server directly with:
```bash
uvx --python 3.10 shotgrid-mcp-server
```

**Important**: The ShotGrid MCP server requires Python 3.10. When using `uvx`, you must specify the Python version with `--python 3.10` to ensure compatibility, as `uvx` may default to using the latest Python version (e.g., 3.13) which is not compatible with this package.

Alternatively, you can set the Python version using an environment variable:
```bash
# Windows
set UV_PYTHON=3.10
uvx shotgrid-mcp-server

# Linux/macOS
export UV_PYTHON=3.10
uvx shotgrid-mcp-server
```

Make sure you have set the required environment variables (SHOTGRID_URL, SHOTGRID_SCRIPT_NAME, SHOTGRID_SCRIPT_KEY) before starting the server.

### Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/loonghao/shotgrid-mcp-server.git
cd shotgrid-mcp-server
```

2. Install development dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

3. Development Commands
All development commands are managed through nox. Check `noxfile.py` for available commands:
```bash
# Run tests
nox -s tests

# Run linting
nox -s lint

# Run type checking
nox -s type_check

# And more...
```

4. Development Server with Hot Reloading

**Note: This requires Node.js to be installed on your system.**

For a better development experience with hot reloading (server automatically restarts when code changes):
```bash
uv run fastmcp dev src/shotgrid_mcp_server/server.py:app
```

This will start the server in development mode, and any changes to the code will automatically reload the server.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required:

```bash
SHOTGRID_URL=your_shotgrid_url
SHOTGRID_SCRIPT_NAME=your_script_name
SHOTGRID_SCRIPT_KEY=your_script_key
```

You can set them directly in your shell:

```powershell
# PowerShell
$env:SHOTGRID_URL='your_shotgrid_url'
$env:SHOTGRID_SCRIPT_NAME='your_script_name'
$env:SHOTGRID_SCRIPT_KEY='your_script_key'
```

```bash
# Bash
export SHOTGRID_URL='your_shotgrid_url'
export SHOTGRID_SCRIPT_NAME='your_script_name'
export SHOTGRID_SCRIPT_KEY='your_script_key'
```

Or create a `.env` file in your project directory.
