# AI Workflow Examples with ShotGrid

This guide demonstrates real-world examples of how to use AI assistants with ShotGrid MCP to streamline production workflows. Each example includes the initial prompt, the expected interaction, and the benefits of using AI for these tasks.

## Daily Review Preparation

### Scenario
You need to prepare for the daily review meeting by gathering all shots that were updated since yesterday and creating a playlist.

### AI Prompt
```
Help me prepare for today's daily review. Find all shots that were updated since yesterday for the "Awesome Project", create a playlist called "Daily Review - April 21", and include a note with a summary of what changed.
```

### Expected Workflow
1. The AI will search for shots updated since yesterday
2. Create a new playlist with those shots
3. Generate a summary note of the changes
4. Provide you with the playlist URL and summary

### Benefits
- Saves time manually searching for updated shots
- Ensures no updated shots are missed
- Provides a clear summary of changes for the review

## Production Progress Reporting

### Scenario
You need to generate a weekly progress report for management showing the status of all shots in the project.

### AI Prompt
```
Generate a production progress report for "Project X" showing:
1. The number of shots in each status category
2. A comparison to last week's numbers
3. A visual chart of the progress
4. A list of any shots that are behind schedule

Format this as a report I can share with the production team.
```

### Expected Workflow
1. The AI will query shot statuses across the project
2. Compare with historical data
3. Generate visual charts using echarts or similar
4. Identify at-risk shots
5. Format everything into a shareable report

### Benefits
- Automates repetitive reporting tasks
- Provides visual data for easier comprehension
- Highlights potential issues proactively

## Client Feedback Processing

### Scenario
After a client review, you have numerous notes that need to be processed and assigned to the appropriate departments.

### AI Prompt
```
We just had a client review for "Forest Sequence" and received a lot of feedback. Help me:
1. Find all notes created today with client feedback
2. Categorize them by department (animation, lighting, comp, etc.)
3. Create tasks for each department based on the notes
4. Generate a summary I can share with the team
```

### Expected Workflow
1. The AI will search for today's notes on the specified sequence
2. Analyze the content to determine which department each note relates to
3. Create appropriate tasks assigned to each department
4. Provide a summary of the feedback organized by department

### Benefits
- Quickly processes large amounts of feedback
- Ensures no feedback is missed
- Automatically routes tasks to the right departments
- Saves time in administrative task creation

## Resource Allocation Optimization

### Scenario
You need to balance workloads across your team based on current assignments and deadlines.

### AI Prompt
```
Help me optimize resource allocation for the "Creature Team" on "Project Z":
1. Show me each artist's current task load and deadlines
2. Identify any overloaded artists or bottlenecks
3. Suggest a rebalanced task distribution
4. Generate a visual representation of before and after workloads
```

### Expected Workflow
1. The AI will query current task assignments and deadlines
2. Analyze workload distribution
3. Identify imbalances or risks
4. Suggest optimal redistribution
5. Visualize the current and proposed states

### Benefits
- Data-driven resource allocation decisions
- Visual representation of workload balance
- Proactive identification of bottlenecks
- Time saved in manual workload analysis

## Shot Continuity Review

### Scenario
You need to ensure continuity across a sequence of shots by reviewing their attributes and notes.

### AI Prompt
```
Help me check continuity for "Chase Sequence" in "Action Movie":
1. Show me all shots in the sequence in order
2. Highlight any inconsistencies in camera settings, lighting, or props
3. Find any continuity notes from previous reviews
4. Create a continuity report I can share with the team
```

### Expected Workflow
1. The AI will retrieve all shots in the sequence
2. Compare technical attributes across shots
3. Search for continuity-related notes
4. Compile findings into a structured report

### Benefits
- Systematic review of continuity factors
- Automatic detection of potential issues
- Comprehensive documentation for the team
- Reduced risk of continuity errors

## Tips for Creating Effective AI Workflows

1. **Start with the end goal** in mind - what specific output do you need?
2. **Break complex workflows** into clear steps
3. **Include context** about the project, sequence, or team
4. **Specify output format** (report, chart, task list, etc.)
5. **Combine multiple operations** to reduce back-and-forth
6. **Ask for visualizations** when dealing with comparative or statistical data
7. **Request actionable next steps** rather than just information

By leveraging AI assistants with these workflow patterns, production teams can significantly reduce administrative overhead, ensure consistent processes, and focus more time on creative work.
