# ShotGrid MCP Server Filter Guide

This guide provides detailed information on how to use filters effectively with ShotGrid MCP Server.

## Basic Filter Syntax

ShotGrid filters are represented as a three-element list: `[field, operator, value]`

For example:
```python
["code", "is", "SHOT001"]  # Find entities with code "SHOT001"
["sg_status_list", "is", "ip"]  # Find entities with status "in progress"
```

When using the MCP server, you'll pass these filters as part of your tool calls:

```javascript
// Find shots in progress
const result = await client.call("search_entities", {
  entity_type: "Shot",
  filters: [["sg_status_list", "is", "ip"]],
  fields: ["code", "description", "sg_sequence"]
});
```

## Common Filter Operators

ShotGrid supports a wide range of filter operators for different data types:

### Text Fields

- `is`: Exact match
- `is_not`: Not equal
- `contains`: Contains substring
- `not_contains`: Does not contain substring
- `starts_with`: Starts with prefix
- `ends_with`: Ends with suffix
- `in`: Value is in list
- `not_in`: Value is not in list

### Numeric Fields

- `is`: Equal to
- `is_not`: Not equal to
- `less_than`: Less than
- `greater_than`: Greater than
- `between`: Between two values
- `in`: Value is in list
- `not_in`: Value is not in list

### Date Fields

- `is`: Equal to
- `is_not`: Not equal to
- `greater_than`: After date
- `less_than`: Before date
- `in_last`: Within last N days/weeks/months/years
- `not_in_last`: Not within last N days/weeks/months/years
- `in_next`: Within next N days/weeks/months/years
- `not_in_next`: Not within next N days/weeks/months/years
- `in_calendar_day`: Today
- `in_calendar_week`: This week
- `in_calendar_month`: This month
- `in_calendar_year`: This year
- `between`: Between two dates

### Entity Fields

- `is`: Equal to entity
- `is_not`: Not equal to entity
- `type_is`: Entity is of type
- `type_is_not`: Entity is not of type
- `name_contains`: Entity name contains
- `name_not_contains`: Entity name does not contain
- `name_is`: Entity name is exactly

## User-Friendly Time Filters

ShotGrid MCP Server supports user-friendly time filter formats:

```javascript
// Find shots created in the last 30 days
const result = await client.call("search_entities", {
  entity_type: "Shot",
  filters: [["created_at", "in_last", "30 days"]],
  fields: ["code", "created_at"]
});

// Find tasks due in the next week
const result = await client.call("search_entities", {
  entity_type: "Task",
  filters: [["due_date", "in_next", "1 week"]],
  fields: ["content", "due_date"]
});
```

The server automatically converts these formats to the ShotGrid API format.

## Special Date Values

You can use special date values in your filters:

```javascript
// Find tasks due today
const result = await client.call("search_entities", {
  entity_type: "Task",
  filters: [["due_date", "is", "$today"]],
  fields: ["content", "due_date"]
});

// Find tasks due yesterday
const result = await client.call("search_entities", {
  entity_type: "Task",
  filters: [["due_date", "is", "$yesterday"]],
  fields: ["content", "due_date"]
});

// Find tasks due tomorrow
const result = await client.call("search_entities", {
  entity_type: "Task",
  filters: [["due_date", "is", "$tomorrow"]],
  fields: ["content", "due_date"]
});
```

## Helper Functions

ShotGrid MCP Server provides several helper functions for common query patterns:

### Find Recently Active Projects

```javascript
// Find projects active in the last 60 days
const result = await client.call("find_recently_active_projects", {
  days: 60
});
```

### Find Active Users

```javascript
// Find users active in the last 14 days
const result = await client.call("find_active_users", {
  days: 14
});
```

### Find Entities by Date Range

```javascript
// Find tasks due between two dates
const result = await client.call("find_entities_by_date_range", {
  entity_type: "Task",
  date_field: "due_date",
  start_date: "2023-01-01",
  end_date: "2023-12-31",
  additional_filters: [["sg_status_list", "is", "ip"]],
  fields: ["content", "sg_status_list", "task_assignees"]
});
```

## Advanced Filter Techniques

### Combining Filters

Multiple filters are combined with AND logic by default:

```javascript
// Find in-progress shots in a specific sequence
const result = await client.call("search_entities", {
  entity_type: "Shot",
  filters: [
    ["sg_status_list", "is", "ip"],
    ["sg_sequence", "is", {"type": "Sequence", "id": 123}]
  ],
  fields: ["code", "sg_status_list"]
});
```

### Using OR Logic

To use OR logic, specify the `filter_operator` parameter:

```javascript
// Find shots that are either in progress or pending review
const result = await client.call("search_entities", {
  entity_type: "Shot",
  filters: [
    ["sg_status_list", "is", "ip"],
    ["sg_status_list", "is", "rev"]
  ],
  filter_operator: "or",
  fields: ["code", "sg_status_list"]
});
```

### Field Hopping (Dot Notation)

You can filter on fields of linked entities using dot notation:

```javascript
// Find shots in sequences with "INTRO" in their name
const result = await client.call("search_entities", {
  entity_type: "Shot",
  filters: [
    ["sg_sequence.Sequence.code", "contains", "INTRO"]
  ],
  fields: ["code", "sg_sequence"]
});
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Use the most specific filters possible to reduce the amount of data returned.

2. **Request Only Needed Fields**: Only request the fields you need to improve performance.

3. **Use Helper Functions**: Use the provided helper functions for common query patterns.

4. **Validate Filters**: The server validates filters automatically, but it's good practice to ensure your filters are well-formed.

5. **Use Field Hopping Wisely**: Field hopping is powerful but can impact performance if overused.

6. **Consider Pagination**: For queries that might return many results, consider using the `limit` parameter.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with filters:

1. **Check Filter Format**: Ensure your filters follow the `[field, operator, value]` format.

2. **Verify Field Names**: Make sure field names are correct and exist on the entity type.

3. **Check Operator Compatibility**: Ensure the operator is valid for the field's data type.

4. **Examine Error Messages**: The server provides detailed error messages for invalid filters.

5. **Test Simpler Filters**: If a complex filter isn't working, try breaking it down into simpler parts.
