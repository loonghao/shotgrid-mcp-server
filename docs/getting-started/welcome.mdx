# ShotGrid MCP Server

ShotGrid MCP Server is a high-performance implementation of the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) for Autodesk ShotGrid. It provides a standardized way for LLMs to interact with your ShotGrid data and functionality, enabling AI assistants to help with production tracking, asset management, and more.

```python
from shotgrid_mcp_server import ShotGridMCPServer

server = ShotGridMCPServer(
    name="ShotGrid Assistant",
    shotgrid_url="https://your-site.shotgunstudio.com",
    script_name="your_script_name",
    api_key="your_api_key"
)

@server.tool()
def find_shots(project_name: str, status: str = None):
    """Find shots in a project with optional status filter."""
    # The server handles ShotGrid connection management for you
    return server.find_shots(project_name, status)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    server.run()
```

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol lets you build servers that expose data and functionality to LLM applications in a secure, standardized way. It is often described as "the USB-C port for AI", providing a uniform way to connect LLMs to resources they can use.

MCP servers can:

* Expose data through `Resources` (think of these as GET endpoints; they are used to load information into the LLM's context)
* Provide functionality through `Tools` (like POST endpoints; they are used to execute code or produce side effects)
* Define interaction patterns through `Prompts` (reusable templates for LLM interactions)

ShotGrid MCP Server implements this protocol specifically for ShotGrid, making it easy to build AI assistants that can interact with your production data.
