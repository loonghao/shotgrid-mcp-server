# Installing ShotGrid MCP Server

ShotGrid MCP Server can be installed using standard Python package managers. We recommend using `uv` for the best performance and dependency resolution.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Access to a ShotGrid instance (or Mockgun for testing)

## Installation Options

### Using UV (Recommended)

[UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a fast, reliable Python package installer and resolver.

```bash
# Install uv if you don't have it
curl -sSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | bash

# Install shotgrid-mcp-server
uv pip install shotgrid-mcp-server
```

### Using pip

```bash
pip install shotgrid-mcp-server
```

## Installing from Source

For the latest development version or to contribute:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/loonghao/shotgrid-mcp-server.git
cd shotgrid-mcp-server
uv pip install -e .
```

## Installing the ShotGrid Python API

ShotGrid MCP Server depends on the ShotGrid Python API. The latest versions don't have published wheel files, so you'll need to install it directly from GitHub:

```bash
# Using uv
uv pip install git+https://github.com/shotgunsoftware/python-api.git@v3.4.0

# Using pip
pip install git+https://github.com/shotgunsoftware/python-api.git@v3.4.0
```

## Verifying Installation

You can verify that ShotGrid MCP Server is installed correctly by running:

```bash
python -c "import shotgrid_mcp_server; print(shotgrid_mcp_server.__version__)"
```

This should print the version number of the installed package.

## Next Steps
