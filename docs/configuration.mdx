# Configuration

ShotGrid MCP Server requires configuration to connect to your ShotGrid instance. This guide will walk you through the necessary configuration steps.

## Basic Configuration

Create a configuration file named `config.json` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "shotgrid": {
    "server": "https://your-site.shotgunstudio.com",
    "script_name": "your_script_name",
    "api_key": "your_api_key"
  },
  "server": {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 8080
  }
}
```

### Configuration Options

#### ShotGrid Connection

| Option | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `shotgrid.server` | URL of your ShotGrid instance | Yes |
| `shotgrid.script_name` | Script name for API authentication | Yes |
| `shotgrid.api_key` | API key for authentication | Yes |
| `shotgrid.http_proxy` | HTTP proxy URL (if needed) | No |
| `shotgrid.connect_timeout` | Connection timeout in seconds | No |

#### Server Settings

| Option | Description | Default | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `server.host` | Host address to bind the server | `127.0.0.1` | No |
| `server.port` | Port to run the server on | `8080` | No |
| `server.log_level` | Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) | `INFO` | No |

## Environment Variables

You can also configure ShotGrid MCP Server using environment variables:

```bash
# ShotGrid connection
export SHOTGRID_SERVER="https://your-site.shotgunstudio.com"
export SHOTGRID_SCRIPT_NAME="your_script_name"
export SHOTGRID_API_KEY="your_api_key"

# Server settings
export SHOTGRID_MCP_HOST="127.0.0.1"
export SHOTGRID_MCP_PORT="8080"
export SHOTGRID_MCP_LOG_LEVEL="INFO"
```

Environment variables take precedence over configuration file settings.

## Using a Configuration File

To start the server with a specific configuration file:

```bash
shotgrid-mcp-server --config /path/to/config.json
```
