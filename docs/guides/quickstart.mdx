# Quickstart Guide

This guide will help you get ShotGrid MCP Server up and running quickly.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1. [Installed](/installation) ShotGrid MCP Server
2. [Configured](/configuration) your ShotGrid connection
3. ShotGrid API credentials (script name and API key)

## Starting the Server

### Using the Command Line

Start the server using the command line:

```bash
shotgrid-mcp-server --config /path/to/config.json
```

If you've set up environment variables, you can simply run:

```bash
shotgrid-mcp-server
```

### Using Python

You can also start the server programmatically:

```python
from shotgrid_mcp_server import create_server

# Create and start the server
server = create_server(
    shotgrid_url="https://your-site.shotgunstudio.com",
    script_name="your_script_name",
    api_key="your_api_key",
    host="127.0.0.1",
    port=8080
)

# Start the server
server.start()
```

## Verifying the Server

Once the server is running, you should see output similar to:

```
INFO:     Started server process [12345]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8080 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

You can verify the server is running by accessing the health check endpoint:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
```

This should return a JSON response indicating the server is healthy.

## Connecting an AI Assistant

To connect an AI assistant to your ShotGrid MCP Server:

1. Configure your AI assistant to use the MCP protocol
2. Point it to your server URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8080`)
3. The AI assistant should now be able to query ShotGrid data using the available tools
