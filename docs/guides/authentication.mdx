# Authentication

ShotGrid MCP Server uses ShotGrid's script-based authentication to connect to your ShotGrid instance.

## Script-Based Authentication

ShotGrid provides a script-based authentication method that uses a script name and API key. This is the recommended authentication method for server-to-server communication.

### Creating a Script User

To create a script user in ShotGrid:

1. Log in to your ShotGrid instance as an admin
2. Go to **Admin > Scripts**
3. Click **+ New Script**
4. Enter a name for your script (e.g., "ShotGrid MCP Server")
5. Select the appropriate permission group
6. Click **Save**
7. ShotGrid will generate a script name and API key

### Permission Groups

When creating a script user, you need to assign it to a permission group. The permission group determines what actions the script can perform in ShotGrid.

For ShotGrid MCP Server, we recommend creating a dedicated permission group with the following permissions:

- **Read access** to all entity types you want to query
- **Write access** to entity types you want to modify
- **Admin access** to schema (if you need to use schema-related tools)

### Configuration

Once you have your script name and API key, you can configure ShotGrid MCP Server to use them:

```json
{
  "shotgrid": {
    "server": "https://your-site.shotgunstudio.com",
    "script_name": "your_script_name",
    "api_key": "your_api_key"
  }
}
```

Or using environment variables:

```bash
export SHOTGRID_SERVER="https://your-site.shotgunstudio.com"
export SHOTGRID_SCRIPT_NAME="your_script_name"
export SHOTGRID_API_KEY="your_api_key"
```

## Security Considerations

- **API Key Security**: Treat your API key like a password. Do not commit it to version control or share it publicly.
- **Least Privilege**: Give your script user only the permissions it needs.
- **Firewall Rules**: Consider restricting access to your ShotGrid instance by IP address.
- **Audit Logs**: Regularly review ShotGrid audit logs to monitor script user activity.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter authentication issues:

1. Verify that your script name and API key are correct
2. Check that your script user has the necessary permissions
3. Ensure your ShotGrid instance is accessible from the server running ShotGrid MCP Server
4. Check for any IP restrictions that might be blocking access
