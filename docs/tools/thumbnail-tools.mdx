# Thumbnail Tools

The ShotGrid MCP Server provides tools for working with thumbnails in ShotGrid. These tools allow you to retrieve thumbnail URLs and download thumbnails for entities.

## Get Thumbnail URL

The `thumbnail_get_url` tool retrieves the URL for an entity's thumbnail.

```python
@server.tool("thumbnail_get_url")
def get_thumbnail_url_tool(
    entity_type: str,
    entity_id: int,
    field_name: str = "image",
    size: Optional[str] = None,
    image_format: Optional[str] = None,
) -> str:
    """
    Get thumbnail URL for an entity.

    Args:
        entity_type: Type of entity.
        entity_id: ID of entity.
        field_name: Name of field containing thumbnail.
        size: Optional size of thumbnail (e.g. "thumbnail", "large", or dimensions like "800x600").
        image_format: Optional format of the image (e.g. "jpg", "png").

    Returns:
        str: Thumbnail URL.
    """
    # Implementation details
```

### Example

```python
# Get thumbnail URL for a Shot with specific size and format
thumbnail_url = await client.call("thumbnail_get_url", {
    "entity_type": "Shot",
    "entity_id": 123,
    "field_name": "image",
    "size": "800x600",
    "image_format": "jpg"
})

print(f"Thumbnail URL: {thumbnail_url}")
```

## Download Thumbnail

The `thumbnail_download` tool downloads a thumbnail for an entity.

```python
@server.tool("thumbnail_download")
def download_thumbnail_tool(
    entity_type: str,
    entity_id: int,
    field_name: str = "image",
    file_path: Optional[str] = None,
    size: Optional[str] = None,
    image_format: Optional[str] = None,
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Download a thumbnail for an entity.

    Args:
        entity_type: Type of entity.
        entity_id: ID of entity.
        field_name: Name of field containing thumbnail.
        file_path: Optional path to save thumbnail to.

    "entity_type": "Shot",
    "entity_id": 123,
    "field_name": "image",
    "file_path": "/path/to/save/thumbnail.jpg",
    "size": "800x600",
    "image_format": "png"
})

print(f"Thumbnail downloaded to: {result['file_path']}")
```

## Batch Download Thumbnails

The `batch_thumbnail_download` tool downloads multiple thumbnails in a single batch operation.

```python
@server.tool("batch_thumbnail_download")
def batch_download_thumbnails(
    operations: List[Dict[str, Any]]
) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Download multiple thumbnails in a single batch operation.

```python
@server.tool("thumbnail_download_recent_assets")
def download_recent_asset_thumbnails(
    days: int = 7,
    project_id: Optional[int] = None,
    field_name: str = "image",

    """
    # Implementation details
```

### Example

```python
# Download thumbnails for the 10 most recently updated assets
results = await client.call("thumbnail_download_recent_assets", {
    "days": 30,  # Look back 30 days
    "field_name": "image",
    "size": "large",
    "image_format": "jpg",
    "directory": "/path/to/thumbnails",
    "limit": 10
})

# Process results
for result in results:
    if "file_path" in result:
        print(f"Downloaded thumbnail to: {result['file_path']}")
    elif "error" in result:
        print(f"Error: {result['error']}")
    else:
        print(f"Message: {result.get('message', 'Unknown result')}")
```

### Example

        "size": "1280x720",
        "image_format": "png"
    }
]

results = await client.call("batch_thumbnail_download", {
    "operations": operations
})

for result in results:
    if "file_path" in result:
        print(f"Thumbnail downloaded to: {result['file_path']}")
    else:
        print(f"Error downloading thumbnail: {result.get('error')}")
```

## Batch Download Thumbnails by Filter

The `thumbnail_batch_download_by_filter` tool downloads thumbnails for multiple entities matching a filter.

```python
@server.tool("thumbnail_batch_download_by_filter")
def batch_download_entity_thumbnails_tool(
    entity_type: str,
    filters: List[Dict[str, Any]],
    field_name: str = "image",
    size: Optional[str] = None,
    image_format: Optional[str] = None,
    directory: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    filter_operator: str = "and",
) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Download thumbnails for multiple entities matching filters.

    Args:
        entity_type: Type of entity.
        filters: Filters to find entities.
        field_name: Name of field containing thumbnail.
        size: Optional size of thumbnail (e.g. "thumbnail", "large", or dimensions like "800x600").
        image_format: Optional format of the image (e.g. "jpg", "png").
        directory: Optional directory to save thumbnails to.
        limit: Optional limit on number of entities to process.
        filter_operator: Operator to use for combining filters ("and" or "or"). Default is "and".

    Returns:
        List[Dict[str, Any]]: Results of the batch operations, each containing file_path.
    """
    # Implementation details
```

### Example

```python
# Download thumbnails for all shots in a project
results = await client.call("thumbnail_batch_download_by_filter", {
    "entity_type": "Shot",
    "filters": [
        {"field": "project.Project.id", "operator": "is", "value": 123},
        {"field": "sg_status_list", "operator": "is", "value": "apr"}
    ],
    "field_name": "image",
    "size": "large",
    "image_format": "jpg",
    "directory": "/path/to/thumbnails",
    "limit": 100,
    "filter_operator": "and"
})

# Process results
for result in results:
    if "file_path" in result:
        print(f"Downloaded thumbnail to: {result['file_path']}")
    elif "error" in result:
        print(f"Error: {result['error']}")
    else:
        print(f"Message: {result.get('message', 'Unknown result')}")
```

## Using Batch Operations for Thumbnails

You can also use the general `batch_operations` tool to download thumbnails along with other operations.

```python
# Mixed batch operations including thumbnail downloads with size and format
operations = [
    # Create a new Shot
    {
        "request_type": "create",
        "entity_type": "Shot",
        "data": {
            "code": "SHOT_001",
            "project": {"type": "Project", "id": 123}
        }
    },
    # Download a thumbnail with specific size and format
    {
        "request_type": "download_thumbnail",
        "entity_type": "Asset",
        "entity_id": 456,
        "field_name": "image",
        "file_path": "/path/to/save/asset_456.jpg",
        "size": "large",
        "image_format": "jpg"
    }
]

results = await client.call("batch_operations", {
    "operations": operations
})

# Process results
for result in results:
    if "type" in result:
        print(f"Created/Updated {result['type']} with ID {result['id']}")
    elif "file_path" in result:
        print(f"Downloaded thumbnail to: {result['file_path']}")
```

## Error Handling

All thumbnail tools include proper error handling. If a thumbnail is not found or cannot be downloaded, a clear error message will be returned.

```python
try:
    result = await client.call("thumbnail_download", {
        "entity_type": "Shot",
        "entity_id": 999,  # Non-existent ID
        "field_name": "image"
    })
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {str(e)}")  # Will print "No thumbnail URL found" or similar error
```

For batch operations, individual errors are included in the results:

```python
results = await client.call("batch_thumbnail_download", {
    "operations": operations
})

for result in results:
    if "error" in result:
        print(f"Error: {result['error']}")
    else:
        print(f"Success: {result['file_path']}")
```

## Validation

All thumbnail tools include validation for:

1. Entity types - validates against ShotGrid schema
2. Field names - validates that the field is an image field for the entity type
3. Size format - must be 'thumbnail', 'large', or dimensions like '800x600'
4. Image format - must be 'jpg', 'jpeg', 'png', or 'gif'

This validation helps prevent errors and provides clear error messages when invalid parameters are provided.
